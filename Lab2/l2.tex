 Destination IP address is the same for the same URL, no matter where the source of the
traceroute is only for the iitd.ac.in .For both other two URL the destination IP address varies in few places.

  \hspace{0.3in}  DNS server changes the address it gives you based on your location. A DNS name may have multiple A records, clients may then choose any record and use that address.
 DNS servers are also giving you different A records depending on your IP address so that you may use a server close to you. The DNS(Domain Name System) is the system to link domain name.ex: www.google.com and IP address
to each other.

\hspace{0.3in} 
The names we use are called domain names, and the databases that we access to map the domain names to IP addresses are domain name servers (DNS). The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) runs the Domain Name System, a series of DNS which map user-friendly names to their corresponding IP addresses.

\hspace{0.3in}Google uses CDN.
CDN nodes(servers) are usually deployed in multiple locations.This may be by directing
requests to locations that are the fewest hops, the lowest number of network seconds
away from the requesting client, or the highest availability in terms of server performance
(both current and historical), so as to optimize delivery across local networks.Simlarly CNN
is using simlar kind of service as they have different destination IP address at different locations.

\textbf{NOTE:} RTT1 and RTT2 are RTT (Machine)  and RTT (https://ping.eu/) respectively both measured in ms.\\

Round-trip time (RTT) is the duration in milliseconds (ms) it takes for a network request to go from a starting point to a destination and back again to the starting point.

\hspace{0.2 in}There is a distance delay and all other things being equal (routing efficiency, processing overhead, congestion, etc.) a site on the west coast accessed by a host on the east coast is going to take longer than if that site is on the east coast .

\hspace{0.2 in}Although a connection optimized by a CDN can often reduce the number of hops required to reach a destination, there is no way of getting around the limitation imposed by the speed of light; the distance between a start and end point is a limiting factor in network connectivity that can only be reduced by moving content closer to the requesting users. To overcome this obstacle, a CDN will cache content closer to the requesting users, thereby reducing RTT.

The UDP rate thus obtained is much larger than the TCP rate that is obtained for the same server,for all three observations.\\

As we can see that UDP rate is much higher than TCP because because UDP is faster,simple 
than TCP and also TCP takes care of retransmisson of lost data packets and also it does a lot
of error checking which UDP does noyt.Hence this makes UDP to be faster than TCP and hence 
higher bitrates.
