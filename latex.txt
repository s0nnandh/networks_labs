\textbf{a)} For this lab assignment , two of our team-mates recorded signal strength. And the recorded data is pictorially represented below.

For Figure 1, for signal strength ranging from \textcolor{green}{0dm to -85dm}  corresponds to \textbf{green color}, for signal strength ranging from \textcolor{yellow}{-85dm to -105dm} corresponds to \textbf{yellow color}, and for signal strength \textcolor{red}{<= -105dm} corresponds to \textbf{red color}.

\textbf{\Large{Figure-1}}\\
During the measurement of signal strength for Figure 1, phone was connected to a total of three unique-base-stations (eNodeBIDs), having eNodeBIDs as follows:
\vspace{-8pt}
\begin{itemize}[itemsep = -2 mm]
\item 941076
\item 941063
\item 941105
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\Large{Figure-2}}\\
 During the measurement of signal strength for Figure 2, phone was connected to a total of three unique-base-stations (eNodeBIDs), having eNodeBIDs as follows:
 \vspace{-8pt}
 \begin{itemize}[itemsep = -2mm]
     \item1568
 \item6185
 \item132086
 \item931
 \item9021
 \item132188
 \end{itemize}
\textbf{c)} For Figure 1, the reasons for poor connection may be because the phone is far away from the base station, and that region is more crowded when compared to other regions during the walk(Due to more crowded ). The sudden change from red to green is due to change in connection with the base station(i.e phone is now connected to a different base station which is near-by with better signal).

\textbf{d)} While standing in a fixed position, the signal strength (RSRP: reference signal received power) varies with time. The image below is plot representing ,how RSRP varies with time at a fixed location.
